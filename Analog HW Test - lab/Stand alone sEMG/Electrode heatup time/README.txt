Oscilloscope
DSOx1102G  || AAU 100996
The sEMG tested is Jans standalone sEMG design.

This test was performed with the 9 cm cabel. 
The test is performed to approximate the time constant for the "optimal" impedance between eletrode and skin. 
The sleeve is placed at the middel of the bicep belly. 
It was not possible to take a continues test with the osxilloscope (AAU: 100996). Therefore the data is split 
into multiple csv files in a increasing order. 
The delay between files is approximately 2 seconds..  

Column one is time and coloum two is voltage read.
