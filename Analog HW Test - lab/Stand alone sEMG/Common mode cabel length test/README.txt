The sEMG tested is Jans standalone sEMG design.


This test was performed with two different lengths of cables, 23 cm and 9 cm, to see the difference in common mode and its correlation
with cabel length.

The cabels are fully exstended and the signal cabels are in a twisted configuration to increase common mode noise radiation ( see picture ).

The data can be viewed in the two csv files, Long.csv and Short.csv for the long and short cabel test respectivly.

Column one is time and coloum two is voltage read.
